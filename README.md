# Antibiotic-Usage-Analysis

# Overview:
This project provides an interactive dashboard to analyze antibiotic prescribing patterns within a healthcare environment. It focuses on key metrics like total prescriptions, antibiotic distribution by time period, average treatment durations, and trends in antibiotic resistance. All data is anonymized to ensure no protected health information is disclosed.

# Key Features:
- Time-Based Analysis: Examine antibiotic usage by quarter, month, or day.
- Drug Frequency: Identify which antibiotics are most frequently prescribed.
- Treatment Duration Monitoring: Track average days of therapy against stewardship targets (e.g., ≤7 days).
-Resistance Tracking: Review the frequency of resistant organisms to inform clinical decision-making.

# Data Privacy:
The dataset does not contain any direct identifiers (names, dates of birth, etc.). Unique Resident IDs are anonymized and cannot be linked to individual identities, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
**Intended Users:**
- Infection prevention specialists
- Healthcare quality improvement teams
- Clinical pharmacists and antibiotic stewardship coordinators

# Usage Instructions:
Load the dashboard file into your preferred visualization tool.
Interact with filters (e.g., month selectors) to narrow down specific timeframes or antibiotic categories.
Review charts and metrics to identify trends and opportunities for intervention.

# Dependencies & Tools:
- Visualization Platform: (e.g., Power BI, Tableau)
- Source Data: Aggregate CSV/Excel files containing anonymized antibiotic usage data

# Customization:
- Adjust date ranges or add/remove metrics by modifying the underlying queries or data sources.
- Incorporate additional resistance data or stewardship benchmarks as needed.

# Support & Feedback:
